The main scope of Squeezer it's to help developers to get fast and reliable code,  tested, implemented and deployed into the cloud , so a
main road blocker was the portability of micro service for being required to deploy your code every time in the cloud
when you want to make some changes and test them. Therefore Squeezer have another unique feature which consists
on simulating a local functions platform on your machine, this way you can test your code without deploying somewhere.
